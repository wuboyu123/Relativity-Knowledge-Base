Custom JSON Configuration

# Custom JSON Configuration

This document provides an overview of the custom JSON configuration file used by Environment Watch. The configuration allows users to centrally define and customize monitoring for:

- Windows services

- Certificates

- SQL servers

- File log receivers

- Scrapers

- It also includes configuration options for Slack notifications used for alerting.

The shared configuration file enables users to control what is monitored such as specific Windows services, certificate conditions, or custom log file sources and how alerts are delivered. Currently, Slack is the only supported notification platform. The notification configuration is designed to be extensible, allowing additional platforms to be supported in future releases. Because the configuration is external to the application, custom monitoring settings are preserved during Environment Watch upgrades, making the solution both extensible and upgrade-safe.

## Configuration Structure

The configuration is organized in a hierarchical JSON format, with top-level sections and nested objects for each monitored entity. It will be saved in the BCPPath and inside the EnvironmentWatch folder. The name of the file will be environment-watch-configuration.json. Below is an example structure and explanation:

## Reference Structure

- Top-level object : environmentWatchConfiguration

- Sections :

- monitoring : Contains configuration for instance, installed products, hosts, and scrapers.

- instance : Defines sources monitored at the instance level.

- installedProducts : A list of installed products, where each product defines its own monitoring sources.

- hosts : A list of hosts, where each host defines its own monitoring sources.

- scrapers : A list of scrapers with configurable intervals and parameters.

- openTelemetryOverrides : Contains custom OpenTelemetry Collector overrides.

- logSources : A list of custom file log source configurations for the OTEL file log receiver.

- alertNotificationHandlers : Defines notification handlers (e.g., Slack).

## Monitoring Sections

### Monitoring by Instance

The instance section defines sources that are monitored at the environment or system-wide level, regardless of specific products or hosts.

- Purpose: Monitors general resources (like certificates or Windows services) that are relevant to the entire instance.

- Use Case: Useful for checks that apply everywhere, such as core system services.

### Monitoring by Installed Product

The installedProducts section contains a list of installed products, where each product defines its own monitoring sources.

- Purpose: Monitors resources specific to each installed product (e.g., web server, agent).

- Use Case: Allows to tailor monitoring to the needs of each product, such as product-specific services or certificates.

- The following installed product values can be used in the installedProducts section of the custom JSON configuration file.

Property Description

Generic No Relativity Product is Installed

QM Queue Manager Server

Worker Worker Server

Agent Agent Server

Web Web Server Server

SecretStore Secret Store Server

ServiceBus Service Bus Server

ServiceHost Service Host Server

SQLDistributed SQL Distributed Server

SQLPrimary SQL Primary Server

Caat Analytics Server

### Monitoring by Host

The hosts section contains multiple host objects, each specifying its own monitoring sources.

- Purpose: Monitors resources on a per-host basis, such as services or certificates unique to a particular server.

- Use Case: Enables granular monitoring for individual machines, supporting host-specific checks (e.g., SQL Services on a database server).

### File Log Configuration

The openTelemetryOverrides section defines custom log source configurations for the OpenTelemetry Collector file log receiver. This allows Environment Watch to collect and parse application-specific log files.

- Purpose: Extends log collection to include custom log files (e.g., RabbitMQ logs) with user-defined parsing rules for log file path, multiline handling, regex extraction, and timestamp parsing.

- Use Case: Useful when complex custom regex patterns need to be defined or when specifying log file paths to ingest logs from different sources (e.g., RabbitMQ, IIS).

### Scrapers Configuration

The scrapers section allows customization of metric collection intervals and parameters for each scraper.

- Purpose: Controls how frequently each scraper collects metrics.

- Use Case: Tune scraper intervals based on environment requirements and performance considerations.

### Monitoring Section Breakdown

Property Description

sources Specifies what is monitored (certificates, windowsServices, sqlServers, etc.)

enabled Boolean flag to enable/disable monitoring for the source.

include List of specific items to monitor (service names, certificate details, etc.)

otelCollectorYamlFiles List of OpenTelemetry Collector YAML files (empty in this example).

openTelemetryOverrides Contains custom OpenTelemetry Collector overrides.

- logSources List of custom log source configurations for the file log receiver.

scrapers List of scraper configurations with intervals and parameters.

## Configuration File Location

Base path: BCPPath

Folder: EnvironmentWatch

File name: environment-watch-configuration.json

Environment Watch automatically reads this file and applies the defined monitoring rules to the relevant instances, products, and hosts.

To identify the BCP path for the environment, navigate to the "Server" tab in the Relativity front end as shown below:

Complete path to the custom JSON configuration file will be:

Copy

```text
\\EMTTEST\BCPPath\EnvironmentWatch\environment-watch-configuration.json

```

An example of the BCPPath and folder structure is shown below:

EW supports all BCP share configuration options available in Relativity. Primary SQL is just one of several supported configurations.

## Monitoring Source Types

This section describes the main types of sources that can be monitored using the Environment Watch configuration: Windows services, certificates, Kibana Alerts through Slack notifications, SQL server instances, file log receivers, and scrapers. Each source type has its own configuration structure and properties. Following are the details for each source type:

### Certificates

For detailed instructions, see Certificates Configuration .

### Windows Services

For detailed instructions, see Windows Service Configuration .

### Slack Alert Notifications

For detailed instructions, see Alert Notification Handlers .

### SQL Server Instances

For detailed instructions, see SQL Server Configuration .

### Scrapers

For detailed instructions, see Scrapers Configuration .

### File Log Receiver

For detailed instructions, see File Log Receiver Configuration .

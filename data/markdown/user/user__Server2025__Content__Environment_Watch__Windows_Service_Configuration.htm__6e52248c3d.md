If the Windows service specified in the custom JSON configuration file cannot be found on the host, an alert will be triggered indicating that the service is stopped or missing. For troubleshooting guidance, refer Troubleshooting section.

### Verification in Kibana

- Navigate to Kibana Dashboard.

- Ensure that the Windows services defined in the custom JSON configuration file appear on the Kibana Windows services dashboard. The example below demonstrates how a Windows service specified in the custom JSON configuration file is successfully monitored and displayed on the Windows services dashboard.
